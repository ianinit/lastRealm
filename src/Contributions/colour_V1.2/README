(Last Revised 24.10.96)

The files distributed with this readme are mostly covered by the Merc and Diku
copyright, and I personally make no claims to them, I do however claim copyright
on the colour code substitution code and changes to the standard files.

You may use and distribute this patch freely with only 1 conditions, you MUST add
the accompanying help for the colour code in its entirity with no changes or
omitions. This also goes for any colour code that you base on this patch.
You may also send email to ant@solace.mh.se stating that you are using this
colour doing so will get you updated on any newer version of the colour that
are released ( I release the versions whenever I upgrade my own colour, the 
released colour being the version that is removed ).

Once the colour is installed you can customise it by adding codes into each
place you want to see coloured. For Examples check the patch files, these
contain some basic colouring added to the channels to start you off.

Once all the code is installed, you must comply with the conditions
of use by including this helpfile entry:

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour    Toggles colour mode on/off

        You may also talk in colour; the format is like this:
	the 'escape character' to specify a colour is the left
	handed brace '{{', following 
	that you should use one of the following letters,
		{r{{r     red     {c{{c     cyan
		{g{{g     green   {y{{y     yellow
		{b{{b     blue    {w{{w     white
		{m{{m     magenta {x{{x     clear(reset colour)
		{{{{      {{ char {{*       beep
		{{/       newline
	when using colour, it looks better if you finish the line
	with whatever colour it would normally be in, such as a
	gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
	looks better than:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

	ColoUr is written by Lope (ant@solace.mh.se)
