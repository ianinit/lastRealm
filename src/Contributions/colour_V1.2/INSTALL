This file explains step by step the installation of colour into your MUD
there are two ways of installing, the simplest is to use one of the patch
files included. These are designed to work on versions of Rom2.3, Envy2.0 and
Rom2.4 with little modification.
Most people should be able to install by copying the patch file into the src/
directory and typing:

patch < patch-[your code base]-colour

If this does not work for you then you can apply the patch by hand, not a nice
job :> INSTALL files for specific code bases may follow later if there is a
significant demand for it.

Once all the code is installed, you must comply with the conditions
of use by including this helpfile entry:

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour    Toggles colour mode on/off

        You may also talk in colour; the format is like this:
	the 'escape character' to specify a colour is the left
	handed brace '{{', following 
	that you should use one of the following letters,
		{r{{r     red     {c{{c     cyan
		{g{{g     green   {y{{y     yellow
		{b{{b     blue    {w{{w     white
		{m{{m     magenta {x{{x     clear(reset colour)
		{{{{      {{ char {{*       beep
		{{/       newline
	when using colour, it looks better if you finish the line
	with whatever colour it would normally be in, such as a
	gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
	looks better than:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x
